# growth-ops-dashboard
Analytics dashboard that automates growth reporting and insights for marketing and ops teams
### Purpose  
This project explores how data and automation can simplify growth reporting and decision-making.  
The dashboard consolidates key business metrics—acquisition, engagement, and revenue—and presents them in a clear, actionable view for marketing and ops teams.  

### What It Does  
Connects to mock data sources (CRM, web analytics, and product telemetry)  
Generates weekly growth summaries and KPIs  
Visualizes metrics with interactive charts (Plotly + Streamlit)  
Highlights anomalies or trends (e.g., drop in conversion rate, surge in retention)  
Suggests possible actions (based on thresholds or historical trends)  

### Example Output  
**Weekly Summary (Mock Example):**  
Revenue Growth: +8.2%  
Conversion Rate: 3.4% → 3.9%  
Churn: 6.1% → 5.8%  
Notable Insight: Paid campaigns drove a 12% lift in engagement.  

### Tech Stack  
**Python** for data handling and logic  
**Pandas / Plotly / Streamlit** for visualization  
**JSON / CSV** as data sources (mock or real)  

### Why I Built It  
After years of leading growth and marketing operations, I’ve seen how teams often spend more time collecting data than taking action.  
This project demonstrates how simple automation and visualization can close that gap and help teams to focus on strategy rather than spreadsheets.

### Future Enhancements  
Connect real APIs (HubSpot, Salesforce, or Google Analytics)  
Add anomaly detection using simple regression models  
Enable email or Slack summaries for weekly reports
